				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Ant is a PHP framework for rapid web application development, designed to be lightweight
					and to have a consistently intuitive MVC-based structure that is as easily navigable in 
						the directory structure as it is the code.</p>
				
				<a name="features"></a>
				<h2>Features, Goals and Cool Snippets</h2>
				<h3>Organisation</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Keep PHP files small by relying heavily on lazy-loading.</li>
					<li>Templating using optimized string replacement</li>
					<li>Separation of database queries, to allow for reusability, extensibility.</li>
					<li>Accessing of controllers directly via whitelisted http requests.</li>
					<li>"Channelling" option, to change output based on the same route.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Tools</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScript and Less.css compiling, optimization.</li>
						<li>Built-in authentication, using Facebook/Google API</li>
						<li>Basic database structure, and user login</li>
						<li>Client detection (e.g. mobile) and custom client views.</li>
					</ul>
				
				<h3>Cool Snippets</h3>
				<p>Let's show off Ant syntax quick so you know why it even needs to exist.</p>
				<h4>Controllers</h4>
				<p>Controllers are stored in intuitive places in the directory structure, 
					so you can find them quickly to modify them. They're not buried inside
						thousands of lines of code.</p>
<pre>
<code>
// Lazy loading controllers  //
$user = Controller :: call('User.getCurrentUser');
</code>
</pre>
				<h4>Queries</h4>
				<p>Queries are stored in a similarly intuitive way as controllers, only using them in memory 
					when needed, and allowing you to further modify them after referencing.</p>
<pre>
<code>
// Reusable lazy loading queries //
$query = Controller :: query('User.getUserById', array(
  'id' => 5
));

$query->join('user_permissions perm ON 
  perm.user_id = user.user_id' );
</code>
</pre>
				<h4>Collections</h4>
				<p>A simple way to store data for various uses, like a filing system. </p>
<pre>
<code>
/* 
 * Collections for storing/manipulating data sets,
 * including relational data
 */
 
$collection = new Collection(array(
 'user_name' => 'batman'
), 'users' );

$collection->first()->join( 
  new Collection(array(
    'user_perm' => 'use-batarang' 
  ), 'user_perms')
);

// Set the primary key //
$collection->setPrimaryKey('user_id');

// Inserts 2 records, one being for the rel table 'user_perms' //
Database :: insert( $collection, function( $insertId ){
  echo $insertId;
});

</code>
</pre>
				<h4>Templating using XML, HTML, and Collections</h4>
				<p>
					This one might not make much sense, but basically, PHP syntax never mixes with html, and vice versa,
					and the html required is always easy to find in the directory structure.
				</p>
				
<pre>
<code>
# .../friends.xml (friends page)
&lt;collections&gt;
  &lt;users ns="friends"&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;context/user/list&lt;/template&gt;
	&lt;collections&gt;
	  // Recursive iteration ... //
	&lt;/collections&gt;
  &lt;/users&gt;
&lt;/collections&gt;


# .../friends.html
&lt;ul&gt;{\friends}&lt;/ul&gt;

# .../user/list.html
&lt;li&gt;{\user_name}&lt;/li&gt;
</code>
</pre>				
				
				<h4>Routing</h4>
				<p>Routing is handled using a combination of the directory structure configuration and XML files which whitelist requests. The XML
					allows you to configure certain aspects of the view, like what module/template is loaded, by using conditionals. The Router studies
						each segment of the URL according to the XML parameters and creates the result arguments for the application to follow.</p>
<pre>
<code>
# .../route.xml
// The URL : http://app.com/home/4 (blog page) //
&lt;base is="home"&gt;
  &lt;next is="about"&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;about&lt;/template&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;about&lt;/module&gt;
  &lt;/next&gt;
  &lt;next when="int"&gt;
    &lt;var&gt;blog_id&lt;/var&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;blog&lt;/template&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;blog&lt;/module&gt;
  &lt;/next&gt;
  &lt;frame&gt;frame_default&lt;/frame&gt;
&lt;/base&gt;

// Resulting arguments //
$module == 'blog';
$template == 'blog';
$blog_id == '4';
$frame == 'frame_default';
</code>
</pre>								
				<h4>Namespacing</h4>
				<p>Ant is namespaced throughout, which means you need a PHP 5.3+ installation, and you need to be familiar with <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php" target="_blank">namespace syntax</a>. It also
					means a lot of the functions in Ant are usable in different contexts, successfully avoiding naming conflicts, allowing you to important one view into another for example, without any issues.</p>
				
				<a name="require"></a>
				<h2>Requirements / Dependencies</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>PHP 5.3+/MySQL on Apache</li>
					<li>Underscore.php</li>
				</ul>
				
				<a name="setup"></a>
				<h2>Setup</h2>
				<p>Download the zip file or fetch the repository from Github.</p>
				
				<p><em>Create a new mysql database</em>, using the name of your project, and then import ant.sql to it. 
					After import you can change the prefix of the tables to the name of your project
						or just leave it as "ant_".</p>
				
				<p>After creating the database and importing the basic Ant structure, 
					you'll need to confirm the local/remote mysql configuration inside
					<code>[version]/config/mysql.php</code>. Within this file you can set
						your database name, as well as your table prefix.</p>
				
				<p>Open the root to your project in your browser, 
					and you should see the Ant Logo. </p>
				
				<h3>Confirming setup by testing</h3>
				<p>To make sure Ant is working properly, you can run the included unit tests,
						using PHPUnit. You can try run these tests immediately, using 
							the url /test.php. This will attempt to run the tests via command line
								using the <code>exec</code> function in PHP. 
								If this doesn't work, or you don't have PHPUnit installed,
									consult the <a href="">Unit Tests</a> section below.</p>
				
				<a name="basics"></a>
				<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
				
				<h3>The Directory Structure</h3>
				<p>Using Ant as your framework requires an understanding of the directory structure. Consider the essentials in this exploded view of the directory:</p>
				
<pre>
0.1.0/
  - app/
    - cache/
    - classes/
    - modules/
      - context/
        - controllers/
        - queries/
        - views/
      - shared/
        - views/
  - config/
  - lib/
  - public/
lib/
tests/
.htaccess
</pre>
				
				<p>In the root, you'll notice a directory with a version number. 
					This is where the current iteration of your application is stored.
						You can store as many sibling versions as you want here, the purpose
							being that you can quickly rollback to a previous version if needs be,
								by changing one line in the .htaccess file.</p>

				<p>The <code>/app/</code> folder stores all the aspects of your application, 
					like models, views, and controllers, and the <code>/config/</code> folder is self-explanatory.<p>
					
				<p>The <code>/lib/</code> folder contains portable code, designed for your
						application but potentially standalone.<p>
					
				<p>The <code>/public/</code> folder contains resources that will be accessible
					via http, like JavaScript, Css styles, and images. Furthermore, this folder
						contains xml that maps the templates to application data from the view.<p>
					
				<h3>The three dimensions of Ant : Shared, Context, and Client</h3>
				
				<p>
					Throughout Ant's directory structure, there are 3 different ways to store files that 
					the application will be able to lazy load.										
				</p>
				<h4>Shared</h4>
				<p>
					Anything in this space, e.g. <code>/app/classes/shared/</code>
					is code that is shared by the application, regardless of the current state. This means
					it is (usually) always included. 
				</p>
				<h4>Context</h4>
				<p>
					In the context space, e.g. <code>/app/classes/context/</code>
					code is available in certain states or <em>contexts</em>. For example, 
					"User" is a context. The context is just a way of organising the code
					for different areas of the application, while allowing them to be accessible
					in a loosely coupled mechanism.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Client</h4>
				<p>
					The client is really a dimension for optimization, e.g. <code>/app/modules/context/mobile/views/home/</code>.
					An application that relies only on responsive design can waste resources. Depending on how your app is designed, the device will load redundant server-side 
					data as well as redundant JavaScript and stylesheets. So the client space allows you to specify device-specific
					server-side and client-side views.
					
				</p>
	
				<h3>The Public directory</h3>
				
				<p>The public directory contains resources like
					JavaScript, Css and images. The public folder also uses the three dimensions discussed above.</p>
				
				<blockquote><p>.htaccess automatically rewrites any requests from <code>public/</code> to <code>0.1.0/public/</code>
						so you don't need to worry about versioning your resources inside the html.</p></blockquote>
				
<pre><code>0.1.0/
  - public/
    - clients/
      - web/
        - css/
        - javascript/
        - templates/
          - en_gb/
</code></pre>
			
				<p>Here you can see that the resources are arranged into different <code>/clients/</code>,
					but if you needed to, you could reference resources from other clients, within your
						html. You would load a resource like a stylesheet as follows:</p>
				
<pre>
<code>&lt;link type="text/css" href="public/../reset.css" /&gt;</code>
</pre>
				<blockquote><p>Ant can dynamically load generated stylesheets using less.css, as well
						as organize them into several defined files according to a "namespace".
						Directly loading JavaScript or Css resources should be avoided for 
						performance and caching reasons.</p></blockquote>
			
				<h3>
					Views, Controllers, and Queries
				</h3>
				<h4>Views</h4>
				<p>
					Views contain logic for displaying a view with all its html and data. The view is either
					shared or in context. The shared view is the frame, the context view is the canvas.
					<br /><br />
					Example request : <code>http://../user/profile</code>
					<br />
					The shared view : <code>/app/modules/shared/views/[client]/frame.php</code>
					<br />
					The context view : <code>/app/modules/context/views/[client]/user/profile.php</code>
					
				</p>
				<p>The Router class handles the <code>route.xml</code> file found in the root of each views folder. This allows
					you to configure (and whitelist) certain URLs to point them to specific PHP files and to load certain templates.</p>
				
				<h4>Controllers</h4>
				<p>
					In Ant, controllers are functions that perform actions. They provide a means of communicating between the View and the Application or the Model.
					Controllers must be defined within a context, because every action within an application must exist in some kind of context.
				</p>
				<p>Controllers can be explicitly called inside the code:</p>
<pre>
<code>
// Get the a user by Id
$user = Controller :: call('User.getUserById', array(
  'id' => 5
));
</code>
</pre>
				<p>Controllers can also be called implicitly from within <code>route.xml</code> under the <code>&lt;controllers&gt; </code> tag.
					This means a URL can perform an action directly in the application (like a form), but it has to be whitelisted by the Router.
					Controllers can also be used for conditioning whether certain html is displayed. This functionality is covered below under <a href="#templates">Templates</a>.</p>
				
				<h4>Queries</h4>
				
				<p>Queries are specific controllers that return a Query object. Ant has the class Query, which handles query building.
					The way queries are handled in Ant encourages reuse. Consider the following example:</p>
				
<pre>
<code>
// Get the query to get user data //
$query = Controller :: query('User.getUser');

// Add some condition //
$query->where('user.user_id = :id', array(
    'id' => 5
));
</code>
</pre>	
				<p>
					The query object can be passed around until the satisfactory query is determined, and then it can be 
					used for database transactions. This means you don't have to build each query from scratch as long
					as you have some foundational queries to work with.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Collections</h3>
				<p>Collections are fairly tightly coupled to other aspects of Ant, because they help manage data and the insertion
					of data into the html. A Collection is a wrapper for data. Most often, it will be used as a representation inside PHP of 
					a series of rows from the database.</p>
				<p>Collections are always namespaced. The namespace, when a Collection reflects a database row, should be the same
					as the table name (omitting the table prefix).</p>

				<pre>
<code>
// Create a new Collection //
$user = new Collection(array(
  'user_id' => 5,
  'user_first_name' => 'Bruce',
  'user_last_name' => 'Wayne'
), 'users' );

// Iterate through the collection //
$user->each( function( $record ){
  if( $record->toObject()->user_id == 5 ){
    // Join a collection to a record //
    $record->join( new Collection(array(
	    'user_id' => 8,
	    'user_first_name' => 'Robin'
      ), 'users_sidekicks') 
    );
  }
});
</code>
</pre>
				<h4>Collections for Templates</h4>
				<p>Ant applies data to templates by using Collections and mapping them to the html using an XML helper.
				Consider the following example:
				</p>
				
<pre><code>
// The XML file (inside the public context/shared directory) //

&lt;collections&gt;
  &lt;users when="User.isBatman"&gt;&lt;users&gt;
&lt;/collections&gt;
</code></pre>
				<p>In the above example, the collection "users" will be applied to the template
					only when the controller returns a boolean of true.</p>
				
				<h4>Collections for Databases</h4>
				
				<p>The collection can be passed to the Database class which will extract the data from
						the collection and attempt to either UPDATE a series of records, or INSERT them into the database.
						If the collection contains data that doesn't belong in the table, the query will naturally fail.
							The namespace of the table is used for getting the table name, along with the prefix 
							set in the MySQL configuration.</p> 

<pre><code>
// Insert a collection into the database //
Database :: insert( $collection, function( $insertId ){
  echo $insertId;
});
</code></pre>
				
				<h3>Templates</h3>
				<p>Ant HTML is not to be stored inside PHP. Any amount of html, no matter how small, 
				should be stored in its own file and imported to the view by using an XML map placed 
					inside the template directory.</p>
				
				<p>The default web frame map:<br/> <code>/public/clients/web/templates/en_gb/shared/frame.xml</code></p>
				<p>A context map: <br /><code>/public/clients/web/templates/en_gb/context/user/profile.xml</code></p>
				
				<p>Inside the map, you specify the Collections to map to the templates, recognizing hierarchical sets of data, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>
// The XML file (inside the public context/shared directory) //

&lt;collections&gt;
  &lt;users&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;context/users/user&lt;/template&gt;
    &lt;collections&gt;
      &lt;friends&gt;
        &lt;template&gt;context/users/friend&lt;/template&gt;
      &lt;/friends&gt;
    &lt;/collections&gt;
  &lt;users&gt;
&lt;/collections&gt;

// The HTML files //

# ../context/users/user.html
&lt;div class="user"&gt;{user_first_name}'s friends : {\friends}&lt;/div&gt;

# ../context/users/friend.html
&lt;div class="friend"&gt;{friend_name}&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
				
				<blockquote><p>Collections that omit a template are assumed to be global by the application, and will be applied inside the lowest level template, like the frame or context.</p></blockquote>
				
				<h3>Routing</h3>
				<p>Ant routing is handled by the Router class and a combination of the directory structure and XML files that configure it. Routing is the process of extracting the information from the request and loading the appropriate application
					state to perform the requested action. Consider the example of the route.xml file:</p>
<pre>
<code>
# .../route.xml
// The URL : http://app.com/home/4 (blog page) //
&lt;base is="home"&gt;
  &lt;next is="about"&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;about&lt;/template&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;about&lt;/module&gt;
  &lt;/next&gt;
  &lt;next when="int"&gt;
    &lt;var&gt;blog_id&lt;/var&gt;
    &lt;template&gt;blog_page&lt;/template&gt;
    &lt;module&gt;blog&lt;/module&gt;
  &lt;/next&gt;
  &lt;frame&gt;frame_default&lt;/frame&gt;
&lt;/base&gt;

// Resulting arguments //
$module == 'blog';
$template == 'blog';
$blog_id == '4';
$frame == 'frame_default';
</code>
</pre>
				<p>The Router will now load the view module <code>blog</code> and create relevant data by automatically calling the function inside this file <code>Ant\[Client]\Home\blog()</code>.
					The html from the template <code>blog_page.html</code> will have the data inserted into it.</p> <p>The resulting output from the view will be imported into the framing template <code>frame_default.html</code>,
					and finally the output will be created and downloaded by the device.</p>
				
				<h3>Advanced Documentation</h3>
				<p>While the documentation is limited at this point in time, you can have a look at the Unit Tests and other examples within the repository to see how the application works on a more advanced and comprehensive level.</p>
				
				
				<a name="tests"></a>
				<h2>Unit Tests</h2>
				<p>Never done unit tests before? Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank">this article</a>. If that article doesn't make sense, the point of unit testing will become apparent from studying the tests contained in this repository. You're basically testing your expectations of what each part of the application should do. And every time you change an aspect of the application, you can check the tests to make sure everything is still working correctly.</p>
				<p>Some Unit tests are already provided using <a href="https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit" target="_blank">PHPUnit</a>. There should ultimately be a unit test for every Ant function or behaviour as the framework grows. </p>
				<p>You can immediately run the included tests using <code>http://path/to/Ant/test.php</code>, which simulates a command line test using <code>exec</code>. These tests will only work if you have PHPUnit installed, and the PHP file
					has correctly configured the path to PHP to be used in <code>exec</code>.</p>
				<p>If you want a visual representation of tests, try out <a href="https://github.com/NSinopoli/VisualPHPUnit" target="_blank">VisualPHPUnit</a>.
				
				<p>Unit testing tightly coupled aspects of a PHP framework may rely on using <code>cURL</code> and examining the response of the request. This is particularly applicable to the testing 
					of routing in the application. For this reason, <code>cURL</code> must be enabled in <em>php.ini</em>.</p>
				
				<a name="roadmap"></a>
				<h2>Roadmap</h2>
				<p>
					The goal of Ant is keep it lightweight and to not fall prey to <em>Zawinski's law of software envelopment</em> regarding software bloat.
				</p>
				<blockquote><p>
					Every program attempts to expand until it can read mail. Those programs which cannot so expand are replaced by ones which can.
				</p></blockquote>
				<p>The point is there is always some PHP library that can handle the tricky, specialist stuff, like reading pop email. Rather look for a reliable library, keep it separate, and simply invoke it inside your application where necessary.</p>
				
				
				<a name="contributing"></a>
				<h2>Contributing</h2>
				<p>Contributions are welcome! Your additions or modifications will be considered for merging with the Ant repository. A branch for each release will be created from the master. Pull requests will be merged to the master branch and eventually be part of a future release branch.</p>
