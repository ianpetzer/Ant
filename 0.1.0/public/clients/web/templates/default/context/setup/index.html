	<h1>Introduction to Ant</h1>
	
	<p>This is the first time you're viewing Ant, so we just want to let you know a couple of things.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Firstly this is <em>not</em> an installation page. 
				You configure everything yourself; this page just exists 
					to give you some pointers.</li>
		<li>Below are some examples of how to create new clients, views, 
				and where to add/edit Less files and JavaScript.</li>
		<li>If you want to know more about Ant and what 
				you can do with it check out

	<h2>Create a new view context</h2>
	<p>You're looking at the Web client. The web client is reserved for desktop browsers. 
		You can serve completely different html depending on the device that's accessing your website.
			But if you don't have more clients configured, Web will be the default.</p>
	
	
	<p>To create a new view context (a top-level page that can have children):</p>
	
	<p>Create the folder <strong><code>{newview.folder}</code></strong></p>
	<p>Create the PHP file <strong><code>{newview.file}</code></strong></p>
	
	<p>Inside your PHP file, you need to declare the route function: </p>
	<pre>
	namespace Ant\Web\{newview.name};

	function index(){
		// This is where you create data for output //
	}
	</pre>
	
	<p>Create the HTML file <strong><code>{newview.html}</code></strong></p>
	
	<p>Add your view to the default route <strong><code>{newview.route}</code></strong> like so:</p>
	
	<pre>
	&lt;base is="home,user,setup,<strong>mynewview</strong>"&gt;
	</pre>
	
	<p>The route will look for index by default, unless you specify otherwise. </p>

	<p>Alternatively, create a route just for this context <strong><code>{newview.newroute}</code></strong></p>
